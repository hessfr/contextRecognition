\section{Motivation}
Recent technological advances of mobile phone have created the possibility (goal??) to quantitatively (??) predict the context of the user. According to Lane et al. this is mainly the result of the following developments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The first item
  \item The second item
  \item The third etc \ldots
\end{itemize}


- Increasing performance of mobile platform enables context recognition

- Help understanding human behaviour better (in a quantitative way)

- Improve human-computer interaction (with example)

- Audio modality can give deeper insights than other, more common modalities like only location
